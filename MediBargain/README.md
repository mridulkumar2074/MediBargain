### Issues Resolved

* Our platform is designed to empower users by offering a distinctive feature - the capability to discover the **most economical** options for their medication requirements on different online platforms. We acknowledge that affordability is a major concern for numerous individuals when purchasing medications, and our website provides a comprehensive solution to address this issue.
* Addressing the primary concern of brand monopoly. We have enhanced our search algorithm to give priority to alternative brands that offer more favorable deals while keeping the salt composition unchanged. When users search for a particular medication, our platform will not only show options from the leading brands but also emphasize alternative brands that offer similar or improved pricing.
